About pseudoicsd
-------------------------------------------
Pseudoicsd is an UPnP device that emulates Microsoft ICS (Internet
 connection sharing).
You can play video and voice chat via Linux-router with this daemon.

This program is built with the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Software
 Development Kit (SDK) for Linux. Thank you very much.

###	This program run on Linux 2.2.x only...

Build and Installation
-------------------------------------------
I.Patch to IP Masuerade code

1) Apply patch(patch_ip_masq) to ip_masq.c 

2) Apply patch(patch_ip_portfw) to ip_masq_portfw.c 

3) Config kernel and make it
   You have to set up this option as follows.
   CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_IPPORTFW=y (NOT 'm')


II.Patch to UPnP SDK

1) Apply patch(patch_ssdplib) to original UPnP SDK.

2) Follow the instructions in the UPnP SDK for Linux README file to 
   build and install the UPnP SDK for Linux library and header files.


III.Build application

1) Copy this tar archive to upnpsdk-1.0.4/sample/.

2) Extract archive.
	tar -zxvf pseudoicsd-0.3.tar.gz

3) Build applications 'pseudoicsd' by typing "make" in the 
   upnpsdk-1.0.4/sample/pseudoicsd/ directory.

4) Make directory /etc/pseudoicsd and move *.skl,*.xml into there.



Configure Linux to Run Sample Applications
------------------------------------------
1) For the UPnP library to function correctly, Linux networking must be 
   configured properly for multicasting.  To do this, type:

        /sbin/route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 eth0

   where 'eth0' is the network adapter that the UPnP library will use.  
   Without this addition, device advertisements, event notifications,
   and control point searches will not function.

2) This application add/delete some rule to/from ipchain automatically.
   And you have to make place-holder before start application as follows.

		/sbin/ipchains -N upnp
		/sbin/ipchains -I input -j upnp

   You should to remove these rules after stop application.

		/sbin/ipchains -D input -j upnp
		/sbin/ipchains -X upnp


Running the Sample Device Application on Linux
----------------------------------------------
1) On the system where the description files were installed as
   described above, run the 'pseudoicsd' application,
   specifying as arguments the name of external interface
   (i.e., eth1, ppp0).
   For the default description document values described above type:

        './pseudoicsd eth1'

   Note that the name of internal interface MUST match 'eth0'.

2) Program will start running, and will print descriptive
   information to the syslog whenever portmap control requests are
   received from client computer.
   To exit the application, type Ctrl-C.
