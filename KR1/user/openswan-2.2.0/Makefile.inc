# Variables in this file with names starting with INC_ are not for use
# by Makefiles which include it; they are subject to change without warning.
#
# "Final" and "finally" refer to where the files will end up on the
# running IPsec system, as opposed to where they get installed by our
# Makefiles.  (The two are different for cross-compiles and the like,
# where our Makefiles are not the end of the installation process.)
# Paths with FINAL in their names are the only ones that the installed
# software itself depends on.  (Very few things should know about the
# FINAL paths; think twice and consult Henry before making something new
# depend on them.)  All other paths are install targets.
# See also DESTDIR, below.

# it; DESTDIR itself should never appear in any other Makefile.
