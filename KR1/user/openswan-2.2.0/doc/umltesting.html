<H1><A name="umltesting">User-Mode-Linux Testing guide</A></H1>
<P> User mode linux is a way to compile a linux kernel such that it can
 run as a process in another linux system (potentially as a *BSD or
 Windows process later). See<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">
 http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</A></P>
<P> UML is a good platform for testing and experimenting with FreeS/WAN.
 It allows several network nodes to be simulated on a single machine.
 Creating, configuring, installing, monitoring, and controling these
 nodes is generally easier and easier to script with UML than real
 hardware.</P>
<P> You'll need about 500Mb of disk space for a full
 sunrise-east-west-sunset setup. You can possibly get this down by 130Mb
 if you remove the sunrise/sunset kernel build. If you just want to run,
 then you can even remove the east/west kernel build.</P>
<P> Nothing need be done as super user. In a couple of steps, we note
 where super user is required to install commands in system-wide
 directories, but ~/bin could be used instead. UML seems to use a
 system-wide /tmp/uml directory so different users may interfere with
 one another. Later UMLs use ~/.uml instead, so multiple users running
 UML tests should not be a problem, but note that a single user running
 the UML tests will only be able run one set. Further, UMLs sometimes
 get stuck and hang around. These &quot;zombies&quot; (most will actually be in
 the &quot;T&quot; state in the process table) will interfere with subsequent
 tests.</P>
<H2><A NAME="34_1">Preliminary Notes on BIND</A></H2>
<P> As of 2003/3/1, the Light-Weight Resolver is used by pluto. This
 requires that BIND9 be running. It also requires that BIND9 development
 libraries be present in the build environment. The DNSSEC code is only
 truly functional in BIND9 snapshots. The library code could be 9.2.2,
 we believe. We are using BIND9 20021115 snapshot code from<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/snapshots">
 ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/snapshots</A>.</P>
<P> FreeS/WAN may well require a newer BIND than is on your system. Many
 distributions have moved to BIND9.2.2 recently due to a security
 advisory. BIND is five components.</P>
<OL>
<LI> named</LI>
<LI> dnssec-*</LI>
<LI> client side resolver libraries</LI>
<LI> client side utility libraries I thought there were lib and named
 parts to dnsssec...</LI>
<LI> dynamic DNS update utilities</LI>
</OL>
<P> The only piece that we need for *building* is #4. That's the only
 part that has to be on the build host. What is the difference between
 resolver and util libs? If you want to edit
 testing/baseconfigs/all/etc/bind, you'll need a snapshot version. The
 resolver library contains the resolver. FreeS/WAN has its own copy of
 that in lib/liblwres.</P>

 potato root file system. You can use this even on a Redhat host, as it
 has the newer GLIBC2.2 libraries as well.
<!-- If you are using
  Redhat 7.2 or newer as your development machine, you can create the
  image from your installation media. See <A HREF="uml-rhroot.html">Building a RedHat root"></A>.
  A future document will explain how to build this from .DEB files as well.

<LI> From a<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">
 http://www.kernel.org mirror</A>, the virgin 2.4.19 kernel. Please
 realize that we have defaults in our tree for kernel configuration. We
 try to track the latest UML kernels. If you use a newer kernel, you may
 have faults in the kernel build process. You can see what the latest
 that is being regularly tested by visiting<A HREF="http://bugs.freeswan.org:81/regress/HEAD/lastgood/freeswan-regress-env.sh">
 freeswan-regress-env.sh</A>.</LI>
<LI>
<!-- Note: this step is refered to as "step 1d" below. -->
 Get<A HREF="http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/">
 http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/</A> uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2 or the one
 associated with your kernel. As of 2003/03/05, uml-patch-2.4.19-47.bz2
 works for us.<STRONG> More recent versions of the patch have not been
 tested by us.</STRONG></LI>
<LI> You'll probably want to visit<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">
 http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net</A> and get the UML utilities.
 These are not needed for the build or interactive use (but
 recommended). They are necessary for the regression testing procedures
 used by &quot;make check&quot;. We currently use uml_utilities_20020212.tar.bz2.</LI>
<LI> You need tcpdump version 3.7.1 or better. This is newer than the
 version included in most LINUX distributions. You can check the version
 of an installed tcpdump with the --version flag. If you need a newer
 tcpdump fetch both tcpdump and libpcap source tar files from<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">
 http://www.tcpdump.org/</A> or a mirror.</LI>

<LI> If you need to build a newer tcpdump:
<UL>
<LI> Make sure you have OpenSSL installed -- it is needed for
 cryptographic routines.</LI>
<LI> Unpack libpcap and tcpdump source in parallel directories (the
 tcpdump build procedures look for libpcap next door).</LI>
<LI> Change directory into the libpcap source directory and then build
 the library:
<PRE>
 <CODE>	./configure
	make
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> Change into the tcpdump source directory, build tcpdump, and
 install it.
<PRE>
 <CODE>	./configure

<LI> open up ../../umlsetup.sh in your favorite editor.</LI>
<LI> change POOLSPACE= to point to the place with at least 500Mb of
 disk. Best if it is on the same partition as the &quot;umlfreeroot&quot;
 extraction, as it will attempt to use hard links if possible to save
 disk space.</LI>
<LI> Set TESTINGROOT if you intend to run the script outside of the
 sandbox/snapshot/release directory. Otherwise, it will configure
 itself.</LI>
<LI> KERNPOOL should point to the directory with your 2.4.19 kernel
 tree. This tree should be unconfigured! This is the directory you used
 in step 2a.</LI>
<LI> UMLPATCH should point at the bz2 file you downloaded at 1d. If
 using a kernel that already includes the patch, set this to /dev/null.</LI>
<LI> FREESWANDIR should point at the directory where you unpacked the
 snapshot/release. Include the &quot;freeswan-snap2001sep16b&quot; or whatever in
 it. If you are running from CVS, then you point at the directory where
 top, klips, etc. are. The script will fix up the directory so that it
 can be used.</LI>
<LI> BASICROOT should be set to the directory used in 2b, or to the
 directory that you created with RPMs.</LI>
<LI> SHAREDIR should be set to the directory used in 2c, to /usr/share
 for Debian potato users, or to $BASICROOT/usr/share.</LI>

 It will grind for awhile. If there are errors it will bail. If so, run
 it under &quot;script&quot; and send the output to bugs@lists.freeswan.org.</LI>

<LI> login to sunrise. run &quot;ping sunset&quot;</LI>
<LI> login to west. run &quot;tcpdump -p -i eth1 -n&quot; (tcpdump must be version
 3.7.1 or newer)</LI>
<LI> Closing a console xterm will shut down that UML.</LI>

<H1><A NAME="35">Debugging the kernel with GDB</A></H1>
<P> With User-Mode-Linux, you can debug the kernel using GDB. See
<!--HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html"-->

 http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html.</P>
<P> Typically, one will want to address a test case for a failing
 situation. Running GDB from Emacs, or from other front ends is
 possible. First start GDB.</P>
<P> Tell it to open the UMLPOOL/swan/linux program.</P>
<P> Note the PID of GDB:</P>
<PRE>
marajade-[projects/freeswan/mgmt/planning] mcr 1029 %ps ax | grep gdb
 1659 pts/9    SN     0:00 /usr/bin/gdb -fullname -cd /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/ linux
</PRE>
<P> Set the following in the environment:</P>
<PRE>
UML_east_OPT=&quot;debug gdb-pid=1659&quot;
</PRE>
<P> Then start the user-mode-linux in the test scheme you wish:</P>
<PRE>
marajade-[kernpatch/testing/klips/east-icmp-02] mcr 1220 %../../utils/runme.sh
</PRE>
 The user-mode-linux will stop on boot, giving you a chance to attach to
 the process:
<PRE>
(gdb) file linux
Reading symbols from linux...done.
(gdb) attach 1
Attaching to program: /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/linux, process 1
0xa0118bc1 in kill () at hostfs_kern.c:770
</PRE>
<P> At this point, break points should be created as appropriate.</P>
<H2><A NAME="35_1">Other notes about debugging</A></H2>
<P> If you are running a standard test, after all the packets are sent,
 the UML will be shutdown. This can cause problems, because the UML may
 get terminated while you are debugging.</P>
<P> The environment variable <CODE>NETJIGWAITUSER</CODE> can be set to
 &quot;waituser&quot;. If so, then the testing system will prompt before exiting
 the test.</P>
<P> The environment variable <CODE>UML_GETTY</CODE> if set, will cause
 each UML to spawn a getty on /dev/tty1, and will wait for it to exit
 before continuing.</P>
<H1><A NAME="36">User-Mode-Linux mysteries</A></H1>
<UL>
<LI> running more than one UML of the same name (e.g. &quot;west&quot;) can cause
 problems.</LI>
<LI> running more than one UML from the same root file system is not a
 good idea.</LI>
<LI> all this means that running &quot;make check&quot; twice on the same machine
 is probably not a good idea.</LI>
<LI> occationally, UMLs will get stuck. This can happen like:
<!--BLOCK-->
 15134 ? T
 0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east)
 [/bin/sh] 15138 ? T 0:00
 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [halt] these
 will need to be killed. Note that they are in &quot;T&quot;racing mode.</LI>
<LI> UMLs can also hang, and will report &quot;Tracing myself and I can't get
 out&quot;. This is a bug in UML. There are ways to find out what is going on
 and report this to the UML people, but we don't know the magic right
 now.</LI>
</UL>
<H1><A NAME="37">Getting more info from uml_netjig</A></H1>
<P> uml_netjig can be compiled with a built-in tcpdump. This uses
 not-yet-released code from<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">
 www.tcpdump.org</A>. Please see the instructions in <CODE>
testing/utils/uml_netjig/Makefile</CODE>.</P>
