.PP
Openswan Starter is aimed to replace all the scripts which are used to
start and stop Openswan and to do that in a quicker and a smarter way.
.PP
It can also reload the configuration file (kill --HUP or periodicaly) and
apply the changes.
.PP
What it will do:
.PP
Load and unload klips (ipsec kernel module)
.PP
Launch and monitor pluto.
.PP
Add, initiate, route and delete connections
.PP
Attach and detach interfaces according to config file
.PP
kill -HUP can be used to reload the config file. New connections will be
added, old ones will be removed and modified ones will be reloaded.
Interfaces/Klips/Pluto will be reloaded if necessary.
.PP
Upon startup, starter will save its pid to the file /var/run/starter.pid
.PP
Upon reloading, dynamic DNS addr will be resolved and reloaded. 
Use --auto_reload to periodicaly check dynamic DNS changes.
.PP
kill -USR1 can be used to reload all connections (delete then add and
route/initiate).
.PP
/var/run/dynip/xxxx can be used to use a virtual interface name in
ipsec.conf. By example, when adsl can be ppp0, ppp1, or some such, one
can do
.B ipsec.conf:             interfaces="ipsec0=adsl"
And use /etc/ppp/ip-up to create /var/run/dynip/adsl
    /var/run/dynip/adsl:    IP_PHYS=ppp0
.PP
%auto can be used to automaticaly name the connections
.PP
kill -TERM can be used to stop FS. pluto will be stopped and klips unloaded
(if it has been loaded). 
.PP Can be used to start FreeS/WAN and load lots of connections in a few
  seconds.
