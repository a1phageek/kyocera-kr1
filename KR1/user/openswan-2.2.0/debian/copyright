This package was debianized by Rene Mayrhofer <rene.mayrhofer@gibraltar.at> on
Thu, 10 Aug 2000 10:50:33 +0200.

The Debian package was created from scratch with some hints taken from
previous freeswan packages by Tommi Virtanen and Aaron Johnson.
The upstream software was downloaded from http://www.freeswan.org/

After the FreeS/WAN folks decided to cease development, we used the forked
code base at http://www.openswan.org/.

This project has multiple authors, please see the file CREDITS for details. 
However, all of the code is DFSG-free and, since 2002-09-16,
the LICENSE file in the upstream distribution includes a special GPL addition 
to allow linking with libdes (which contains and advertising clause). 
This LICENSE file was added to the Debian package of freeswan version 1.98b 
by me, but has been authorized by Michael Richardson of freeswan upstream 
(who sent the file to a mailing list).

The contents of this LICENSE file are:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except for the DES library, this software is under the GNU Public License,
see the file COPYING.

The DES library is under a BSD style license, see
	linux/crypto/ciphers/des/COPYRIGHT.
Note that this software has a advertising clause in it.

In addition to the terms set out under the GPL, permission is granted to
link the software against the libdes library just mentioned.

The MD5 implementation is from RSADSI, so this package must include the
following phrase:  "derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5
Message-Digest Algorithm".  It is not under the GPL; see details in
klips/net/ipsec/ipsec_md5c.c.

An implementation of DES:

--8<--
The LIBDES library by Eric Young is used.  It is not under the GPL -- see
details in libdes/COPYRIGHT -- although he has graciously waived the
advertising clause for FreeS/WAN use of LIBDES. 
--8<--

--8<--
Copyright (C) 1995-1997 Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)
All rights reserved.

This package is an DES implementation written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).
The implementation was written so as to conform with MIT's libdes.

This library is free for commercial and non-commercial use as long as
the following conditions are aheared to.  The following conditions
apply to all code found in this distribution.

Copyright remains Eric Young's, and as such any Copyright notices in
the code are not to be removed.
If this package is used in a product, Eric Young should be given attribution
as the author of that the SSL library.  This can be in the form of a textual
message at program startup or in documentation (online or textual) provided
with the package.

modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
are met:
1. Redistributions of source code must retain the copyright
   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the
   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

The license and distribution terms for any publically available version or
derivative of this code cannot be changed.  i.e. this code cannot simply be
copied and put under another distrubution license
[including the GNU Public License.]

The reason behind this being stated in this direct manner is past
experience in code simply being copied and the attribution removed
from it and then being distributed as part of other packages. This
implementation was a non-trivial and unpaid effort.

The license from the OpenSSL code that is included in the extension algorithm
patch (the kernel-patch-freeswan-ext package):

--8<--
  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
