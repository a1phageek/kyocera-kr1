openswan (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took the package as official maintainer.
  * Updated all relevant packaging stuff to the level of freeswan 2.04-9,
    including auto-generation of X.509 certificates and insertion in 
    ipsec.secrets. This also corrects the libexec path in some scripts.
