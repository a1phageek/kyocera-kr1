The authenticator and supplicant are obtained from
the open source development site: http://hostap.epitest.fi/

The Makefiles and configuration files have been edited
for this Madwifi distribution environment.

The directory "test_auth" contains some notes and scripts
for a simple test of the authenticator with WPA-PSK.
