This directory contains the bits needed to integrate the madwifi source
distribution into a Linux kernel source tree.  To do this unpack the
kernel distribution, then run the install.sh script from the 2.4 or
2.6 subdirectory as appropriate.  If you want to patch the currently
running system you can do

sh install.sh

otherwise you can specify the source tree location on the command line:

sh install.sh /usr/src/linux

The following directories will be created and populated:

net/net80211
drivers/net/wireless/_ath_hal
drivers/net/wireless/ath
drivers/net/wireless/hal

The appropriate kernel build files will be patched so that you can
run "make menuconfig" or similar and configure the driver using the
normal mechanisms.

Note that this has been done for 2.6 and 2.4.24 kernels.  You may
need to generate some additional patch files for your kernel sources
to automate this procedure.  Use the supplied files for guidance.
