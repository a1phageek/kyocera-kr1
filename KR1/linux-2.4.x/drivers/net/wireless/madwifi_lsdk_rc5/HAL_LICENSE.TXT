Appendix A Addendum


All versions of the Atheros HAL Souce Code License Agreement include
an Appendix A that lists specific files in the device driver that are
subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  The Agreement
also applies to updates to the listed files.  This distribution is an
update to the files listed in Appendix A (and any previous updates)
which, by using, you acknowledge is covered by the Agreement.


The source distribution is organized into open-source or protected-source
directories.  The "madwifi" directory and everything within it are
open-source, copyrighted, and covered by the BSD license although it
can be licensed in turn under the GPL, at the discretion of the user.
The "wpa" directory and its subdirectories are also dual-licensed
as described within the files.  These are the only two open-source
directories included in this distribution.


All other directories at the same level as "madwifi" and "wpa",
including but not limited to "hal", "ratectrl", "phyerr", and "tx99", are
protected-source directories which are subject to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement.  The files in these directories may not be distributed
as source code, may not be sub-licensed without an additional specific
licensing agreement directly with Atheros, and may only be distributed
in products as binary loadable kernel object modules, as described and
permitted in the Agreement.
