config KLIPS
	tristate "FreeS/WAN IPsec (KLIPS)"
	default n
	help
  	  KLIPS is the FreeS/WAN (www.freeswan.org) Kernel Level IP Security
	  system. It is extensively tested, and has interoperated with
	  many other systems. 
          It provides "ipsecX" devices on which one can do firewalling.
 	  It is maintained outside of the United States, so no export
	  controls apply (nor any fear of retroactive controls being imposed
	  by USA's BXA).  
          The userland, is compatible with both KLIPS and 26sec.

config KLIPS_AUTH_HMAC_MD5
	bool 'HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm' 
	default y
	help
           The HMAC-MD5 algorithm is used by ESP (and AH) to guarantee packet
	   integrity. There is little reason not to include it.

config KLIPS_AUTH_HMAC_SHA1
	bool 'HMAC-SHA1 authentication algorithm' 
	default y
	help
           The HMAC-SHA1 algorithm is used by ESP (and AH) to guarantee packet
	   integrity. SHA1 is a little slower than MD5, but is said to be 
	   a bit more secure. There is little reason not to include it.

config KLIPS_ENC_3DES
	bool '3DES encryption algorithm'
	default y
	help
           The 3DES algorithm is used by ESP to provide for packet privacy.
	   3DES is 3-repeats of the DES algorithm. 3DES is widely supported,
	   and analyzed and is considered very secure. 1DES is not supported.

config KLIPS_IPCOMP
	bool 'IP compression'
	default y
	help
           The IPcomp protocol is used prior to ESP to make the packet
	   smaller. Once encrypted, compression will fail, so any link
	   layer efforts (e.g. PPP) will not work. 

config KLIPS_DEBUG
	bool 'IPsec debugging'
	default y 
	help
           KLIPS includes a lot of debugging code. Unless there is a real
	   tangible benefit to removing this code, it should be left in place.
	   Debugging connections without access to kernel level debugging is
	   essentially impossible. Leave this on.
